            George Lucas recruits Ed Catmull from the New York Institute of 
            Technology to head Lucasfilm's Computer Division, a group charged 
            with developing state-of-the-art computer technology for the film 
            industry. Lucas's wish list: a digital (nonlinear) film editing system, a 
            digital (nonlinear) sound editing system, a laser film printer, and further 
            exploration of computer graphics. The following year, he is joined by 
            Alvy Ray Smith, who is hired as Director of Computer Graphics 
            Research.
